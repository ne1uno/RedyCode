=RedyCode 0.9.4

RedyCode™ is an open source Integrated Development Environment for the Euphoria
programming language. It is easy enough for beginners to learn GUI programming,
yet powerful enough for experienced programmers to make professional-quality
applications.

RedyCode helps you write GUI applications based on the Redy™ environment. Redy
provides a collection of libraries called "redylib".

The word "Redy" is the Middle English spelling of the word "ready". The logo is
based on the "READY." prompt of old computers, reminiscing the simplicity and
efficiency that computers once had. The definition of this word represents the
desired attributes of this GUI environment:

* prepared or available for service, action, or progress
* prompt in apprehending or reacting
* available for immediate use
* in a state of completion or preparedness
* prompt or rapid
* poised for use or action
* completely prepared or in fit condition for action or use
* quick in action, performance, manifestation, etc.
