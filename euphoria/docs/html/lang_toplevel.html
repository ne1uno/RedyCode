<p> Before any of your statements are executed, the Euphoria front-end quickly reads your entire program. All statements are syntax checked and converted to a low-level intermediate language (IL).  The interpreter immediately executes the IL after it is completely generated. The translator converts the IL to C. The binder/shrouder saves the IL on disk for later execution. These three tools all share the same front-end (written in Euphoria).</p>

<p> If your program contains only routine and variable declarations, but no top-level executable statements, then nothing will happen when you run it (other than syntax checking). You need a top-level statement to call your main routine (see <a href="examples.html#_52_exampleprograms">Example Programs</a>).  It's quite possible to have a program with nothing but top-level executable statements and no routines. For example you might want to use Euphoria as a simple calculator, typing just a few <a href="std_io.html#_1506_print">print</a> or <a href="std_io.html#q_print">?</a> statements into a file, and then executing it.</p>

<p> As we have seen, you can use any Euphoria statement, including <a href="lang_loop.html#_164_forstatement">for statement</a>, <a href="lang_loop.html#_160_whilestatement">while statement</a>, <a href="lang_branch.html#_146_ifstatement">if statement</a>, etc... (but not <a href="lang_decl.html#_115_returnstatement">return</a>), at the top level i.e. <em>outside</em> of any <a href="lang_decl.html#_114_functions">function</a> or <a href="lang_decl.html#_113_procedures">procedure</a>. In addition, the following special statements may <em>only</em> appear at the top level:</p>
<ul><li><tt>include</tt>
</li><li><tt>with</tt> / <tt>without</tt>
</li></ul>
<!-- ..\docs\refman_2.txt -->
<h3>4.8.1 include statement</h3>
<a name="_178_includestatement"></a><a name="includestatement"></a>
<p> When you write a large program it is often helpful to break it up into logically separate files, by using <strong>include statements</strong>. Sometimes you will want to reuse some code that you have previously written, or that someone else has written. Rather than copy this code into your main program, you can use an <strong>include statement</strong> to refer to the file containing the code. The first form of the include statement is:</p>

<p> <dl>
<dt><tt>include <em>filename</em></tt>
</dt>
<dd>This reads in (compiles) a Euphoria source file.</dd>
</dl>
Some Examples:</p>

<pre class="examplecode"><font color="#0000FF">include </font><font color="#330033">std/graphics.e</font>
<font color="#0000FF">include </font><font color="#330033">/mylib/myroutines.e</font>
<font color="#0000FF">public include </font><font color="#330033">library.e</font>
</pre>

<p> Any top-level code in the included file will be executed at start up time.</p>

<p> Any <tt>global</tt> identifiers that are declared in the file doing the including will also be visible in the file being included. However the situation is slightly different for an identifier declared as <strong>public</strong> or <strong>export</strong>. In these cases the file being included will <strong>not</strong> see <tt>public/export</tt> symbols declared in the file doing the including, unless the file being included also explicitly includes the file doing the including. Yes, you would better read that again because its not that obvious. Here's an example...</p>

<p> We have two files, a.e and b.e ... </p>

<pre class="examplecode"><font color="#FF0055">-- a.e --</font>
<font color="#330033">? c </font><font color="#FF0055">-- declared as global in 'b.e'</font>
</pre>

<pre class="examplecode"><font color="#FF0055">-- b.e --</font>
<font color="#0000FF">include </font><font color="#330033">a.e</font>
<font color="#0000FF">global integer </font><font color="#330033">c = 0</font>
</pre>

<p> This will work because being <tt>global</tt> the symbol 'c' in b.e can be seen by all files in this <em>include tree</em>.</p>

<p> However ... </p>

<pre class="examplecode"><font color="#FF0055">-- a.e --</font>
<font color="#330033">? c </font><font color="#FF0055">-- declared as public in 'b.e'</font>
</pre>

<pre class="examplecode"><font color="#FF0055">-- b.e --</font>
<font color="#0000FF">include </font><font color="#330033">a.e</font>
<font color="#0000FF">public integer </font><font color="#330033">c = 0</font>
</pre>

<p> Will not work as public symbols can only be seen when their declaring file is explicitly included. So to get this to work you need to write a.e as ... </p>

<pre class="examplecode"><font color="#FF0055">-- a.e --</font>
<font color="#0000FF">include </font><font color="#330033">b.e</font>
<font color="#330033">? c </font><font color="#FF0055">-- declared as public in 'b.e'</font>
</pre>

<hr />
<strong>N.B.</strong> Only those symbols declared as <tt>global</tt> in the included file will be visible (accessible) in the remainder of the including file. Their visibility in other included files or in the main program file depends on other factors. Specifically, a global symbols can only be accessed by files in the same <em>include tree</em>. For example...</p>

<p> If we have danny.e declare a global symbol called 'foo', and bob.e includes danny.e, then code in bob.e can access danny's 'foo'. Now if we also have cathy.e declare a global symbol called 'foo', and anne.e includes cathy.e, then code in ann.e can access cathy's 'foo'. Nothing unusual about that situation. Now, if we have a program that includes both bob.e and anne.e, the code in bob.e and anne.e should still work even though there are now two global 'foo' symbols available. This is because the include tree for bob.e <em>only</em> contains danny.e and likewise the include tree for anne.e <em>only</em> contains cathy.e. So as the two 'foo' symbols are in separate include trees (from bob.e and anne.e perspective) code in those files continues to work correctly. A problem can occur if the main program (the one that includes both bob.e and anne.e) references 'foo'. In order for Euphoria to know which one the code author meant to use, the coder must use the namespace facility. </p>

<pre class="examplecode"><font color="#FF0055">--- mainprog.ex ---</font>
<font color="#0000FF">include </font><font color="#330033">anne.e </font><font color="#0000FF">as </font><font color="#330033">anne</font>
<font color="#0000FF">include </font><font color="#330033">bob.e  </font><font color="#0000FF">as </font><font color="#330033">bob</font>

<font color="#330033">anne:foo</font><font color="#880033">() </font><font color="#FF0055">-- Specify the 'foo' from anne.e.</font>
</pre>

<p> If the above code did not use namespaces, Euphoria would not have know which 'foo' to use -- the one from bob.e or the one in anne.e.</p>

<p> If public precedes the include statement, then all public identifiers from the included file will also be visible to the including file, and visible to any file that includes the current file.</p>

<p> If an absolute <em>filename</em> is given, Euphoria will open it and start parsing it. When a relative <em>filename</em> is given, Euphoria will try to open the file relative to the following directories, in the following order:</p>
<ol><li>The directory containing the current source file.  i.e. the source file that contains the include statement that is being processed.
</li><li>The directory containing the main file given on the interpreter, translator or binder -- see <a href="std_cmdline.html#_779_command_line">command_line</a>.
</li><li>If you've defined an environment variable named <tt>EUINC</tt>, Euphoria will check each directory listed in <tt>EUINC</tt> (from left to right).  <tt>EUINC</tt> should be a list of directories, separated by semicolons (colons on <em>Linux</em> / <em>FreeBSD</em>), similar in form to your <tt>PATH</tt> variable. <tt>EUINC</tt> can be added to your set of <em>Linux</em> / <em>FreeBSD</em> or <em>Windows</em> environment  variables. (Via <tt>Control Panel / Performance &amp; Maintenance / System / Advanced</tt> on <em>XP</em>, or <tt>AUTOEXEC.BAT</tt> on older versions of <em>Windows</em>).  e.g. <tt>SET EUINC=C:\EU\MYFILES;C:\EU\WINDOWSLIB</tt>  <tt>EUINC</tt> lets you organize your include files according to application areas, and avoid adding numerous unrelated files to <tt>euphoria\include</tt>.
</li><li>Finally, if it still hasn't found the file, it will look in  <tt>euphoria\include</tt>.  This directory contains the standard Euphoria include files. The environment variable <tt>EUDIR</tt> tells Euphoria where to find your <tt>euphoria</tt> directory.
</li></ol>
<p>An included file can include other files. In fact, you can "nest" included files up to 30 levels deep.</p>

<p> Include file names typically end in <tt>.e</tt>, or sometimes <tt>.ew</tt> or <tt>.eu</tt> (when they are intended for use with <em>Windows</em> or <em>Unix</em>).  This is just a convention. It is not required.</p>

<p> If your filename (or path) contains blanks or escape-able characters , you must enclose it in double-quotes, otherwise quotes are optional. When a filename is enclosed in double-quotes, you can also use the standard escape character notation to specify filenames that have non-ASCII characters in them.</p>

<p> Note that under Windows, you can also use the forward slash '/' instead of the usually back-slash '\'. By doing this, the file paths are compatible with <em>Unix</em> systems and it means you don't have to 'escape' the back-slashes. <br />
For example:</p>

<pre class="examplecode"><font color="#0000FF">include </font><font color="#330033">"c:/program files/myfile.e"</font>
</pre>

<p> Other than possibly defining a new namespace identifier (see below), an include statement will be quietly ignored if the same file has already been included.</p>

<p> An include statement must be written on a line by itself.  Only a comment can appear after it on the same line.</p>

<p> 
<a name="as"></a> The second form of the include statement is:</p>

<p> <dl>
<dt><tt>include<strong> </strong><em>filename</em> as <em>namespace_identifier</em></tt>:
</dt>
<dd>This is just like the simple include, but it also defines a <em>namespace identifier</em> that can be attached to global identifiers in the included file that  you want to refer to in the main file. This might be necessary to disambiguate references to those identifiers, or you might feel that it makes your code more readable. This <tt>as identifier</tt> namespace exists in the current file, along with   any <tt>namespace identifier</tt> the included file may define.</dd>

<h3>4.8.2 with / without</h3>
<a name="_180_withwithout"></a><a name="withwithout"></a>
<p> These special statements affect the way that Euphoria translates your program into internal form. Options to the <tt>with</tt> and <tt>without</tt> statement come in two flavors. One simply turns an option on or off, while the others have multiple states.</p>

<p> <tt>with</tt> turns <strong>on</strong> one of the options and <tt>without</tt> turns <strong>off</strong> one of the options.</p>

<p> For more information on the <tt>profile</tt>, <tt>profile_time</tt> and <tt>trace</tt> options, see <a href="debug.html#_515_debuggingandprofiling">Debugging and Profiling</a>. For more information on the <tt>type_check</tt> option, see <a href="perform.html#_653_performancetips">Performance Tips</a>.</p>

<p> There is also a rarely-used special <tt>with</tt> option where a code number appears after <tt>with</tt>.  In previous releases this code was used by RDS to make a file exempt from adding to the statement count in the old "Public Domain" Edition. This is not used any longer, but does not cause an error.</p>

<p> You can select any combination of settings, and you can change the settings, but the changes must occur <em>between</em> subroutines, not within a subroutine. The only exception is that you can only turn on one type of profiling for a given run of your program.</p>

<p> An <strong>included file</strong> inherits the <strong>with/without</strong> settings in effect at the point where it is included.  An included file can change these settings, but they will revert back to their original state at the end of the included file.  For instance, an included file might turn off warnings for itself and (initially) for any files that it includes, but this will not turn off warnings for the main file.</p>

<p> <strong>
<a name="indirect_includes"></a><a name="includes"></a>indirect_includes</strong>, This <tt>with/without</tt> option changes the way in which global symbols are resolved.  Normally, the parser uses the way that files were included to resolve a usage of a global symbol.  If <tt>without indirect_includes</tt> is in effect, then only direct includes are considered when resolving global symbols.</p>

<p> This option is especially useful when a program uses some code that was developed for a prior version of Euphoria that uses the pre-4.0 standard library, when all exposed symbols were global.  These can often clash with symbols in the new standard library.  Using <tt>without indirect_includes</tt> would not force a coder to use namespaces to resolve symbols that clashed with the new standard library.</p>

<p> Note that this setting does not propagate down to included files, unlike most <tt>with/without options</tt>.  Each file begins with <tt>indirect_includes</tt> turned on.</p>

<p> <strong>
<a name="with_batch"></a><a name="batch"></a>with batch</strong>, Causes the program to not present the "Press Enter" prompt if an error occurs. The exit code will still be set to 1 on error. This is helpful for programs that run in a mode where no human may be directly interacting with it. For example, a CGI application or a CRON job.</p>

<p> You can also set this option via a <a href="command_switches.html#batch_command_line">command line parameter</a>.</p>

<h5>with / without warning</h5>
<a name="_185_withwithoutwarning"></a><a name="withwithoutwarning"></a>
<p> Any warnings that are issued will appear on your screen after your program has finished execution. Warnings indicate minor problems.  A warning will never terminate the execution of your program. You will simply have to hit the Enter key to keep going -- which may stop the program on an unattended computer.</p>

<p> The forms available are ...</p>

<p> <dl>
<dt><tt>with warning</tt>

</dt>
<dd>disables listed warnings and leaves any not listed in its current state.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><tt>with warning save</tt>
</dt>
<dd>saves the current warning state, i.e. the list of all enabled   warnings. This destroys any previously saved state.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><tt>with warning restore</tt>
</dt>
<dd>causes the previously saved state to be restored.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><tt>without warning strict</tt>
</dt>
<dd>overrides some of the warnings that the -STRICT command line option tests for,   but only until the end of the next function or procedure. The warnings overridden   are   * default_arg_type   * not_used   * short_circuit   * not_reached   * empty_case   * no_case_else</dd>
</dl>

<p> The <strong>with/without warnings</strong> directives will have no effect if the <tt>-STRICT</tt> command line switch is used. The latter turns on all warnings and ignores any <strong>with/without warnings</strong> statement. However, it can be temporarily affected by the "<tt>without warning strict</tt>" directive.</p>

<h4>4.8.2.3 with / without inline</h4>
<a name="_189_withwithoutinline"></a><a name="withwithoutinline"></a>
<p> This directive allows coders some flexibility with inlined routines. The default is for inlining to be on.  Any routine that is defined when <tt>without inline</tt> is in effect will never be inlined.</p>

<p> <tt>with inline</tt> takes an optional integer parameter that defines the largest routine (by size of IL code) that will be considered for inlining.  The default is 30. </p>
