Redy™ is an open source project written in the Euphoria programming language 
that helps you write GUI applications in Euphoria by providing a collection of 
libraries and programs that follow specific standards. It is easy enough for 
beginners to learn GUI programming, yet powerful enough for experienced 
programmers to make professional-quality applications.

The word "Redy" is the Middle English spelling of the word "ready". The logo is 
based on the "READY." prompt of old computers, reminiscing the simplicity and 
efficiency that computers once had. The definition of this word represents the 
desired attributes of this GUI environment:

* prepared or available for service, action, or progress
* prompt in apprehending or reacting
* available for immediate use
* in a state of completion or preparedness
* prompt or rapid
* poised for use or action
* completely prepared or in fit condition for action or use
* quick in action, performance, manifestation, etc.
